Web forms

a. Description of the Project. 
    This is an introductory project working on designing web forms and learning best practices. This survey does not collect data, as it is a static website. 

b. How did these web forms conform to best practices? 
    I did not collect data that was not needed, this assignment required a question regarding gender, but I did not collect any other demographic or personal information that was not necessary. This practice allows survey-takers to not have to admit to personal information they may not want to disclose, and feel more comfortable taking the survey. I also tried to include many options for gender, so that it is inclusive for all users.  

    Another best practice is that my web form is structured as a long, vertical form. This best practice allows those taking the survey to complete it in the most efficient manner, without getting too overwhelmed. Further, I also only asked 5-7 questions per page, again to not overwhelm or frustrate those submitting these forms. I also added a footer containing "page 1 of 2", so users know their progress in the survey. 

    Finally, I added in required fields and placeholder values to supplement the user with information, to improve clarity on the survey. For example, in phone number, my preferred response format is displayed in the placeholder. I also ensured that I used dark fonts on a light background for easy reading, and that my code was all valid and passed WCAG 2.1 level AA guidelines.
